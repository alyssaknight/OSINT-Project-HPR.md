Info
OPERATIONS DIRECTOR
Charles Husson has been with HPR since 1994. He grew up in Tidewater, Virginia, playing music part-time during high-school and college. He moved to New York City in 1982 to explore the wider musical opportunities there, working for the Associated Press as an accountant in AP Broadcast, then as Satellite Operations Manager during the day, and playing music at night. Moving to Honolulu in 1991, he decided to try his hand at radio. “I was one of those kids who fantasized about being a DJ, but I never had the guts to follow up on it.” Hired as a board operator by previous Operations Director Mark Wagner, Charles was promoted to Ops Director in March 2002. In addition to managing the operations staff, he also voices underwriting credits and promos for the station. “Radio never stops, and the job is a pleasure; there is structure to it, but also different challenges every day.” Following the passing of Don Gordon, he has taken on the hosting duties for jazz in the evening. “For me, there’s nothing better than playing music for people in the evening while they’re relaxing after a day of work.”
